# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my COVID-19 Data Analysis project! As you may have guessed, this project is all about analyzing data related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help us better understand the impact of COVID-19 on different countries and continents. We'll be looking at things like total cases, total deaths, and vaccination rates to get a clearer picture of how the pandemic has affected different parts of the world.

## Data Sources

We used two datasets for this project: one containing COVID-19 data (cases, deaths, etc.) and another containing data on COVID-19 vaccinations. We used these datasets to create a variety of visualizations and dashboards to help us make sense of the data.

## Tools Used

For this project, we used SQL to query and manipulate the data. We also used Tableau to create interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## Project Structure

Our SQL code includes various queries that help us extract the data we need for analysis. We've organized these queries into different sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the data.

## Tableau Dashboard

To make the data more accessible and user-friendly, we created a Tableau dashboard that summarizes our findings. You can access this dashboard by visiting the following link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/krishna.tej.bhat7962/viz/GlobalCOVID-19DataAsofJanuary2022/Dashboard1

## Conclusion

And that's it! I hope this project has helped you understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world. Remember, stay safe, wear a mask, and wash your hands! And if all else fails, just pray to the SQL gods for mercy.
